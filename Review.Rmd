All of your files seems correct and clean
I had to install the tidyverse package and load the readr program, but after that it was all good.
I also would suggest just reading the files from the internet. it just makes things easier by not having to deal with paths and downloaded files.

Your graphs were different from mine but similar. I plotted the frequency of snps for chromosomes, but you plotted the frequency of snps for groups. It looks right for that though.

Also, for the second plot, I thought it was pretty cool how you assigned a value to each of the homozygous snps and plotted the number of times each value showed up. you melted the data sets well. I really struggled with that. I assigned a loop that replaced stuff with values to a loop, then I plotted it out. I had to get a rough idea of the loops from online and had a buddy work me through it. your way seemed to work way better.

I didn't know about tidyverse. Seems pretty cool. I also didn't know how to write tables to a specific path. pretty neat.

-Dr. Lavrov, I say this is A+ work!
